# WinBatchX Repository Update System
The WinBatchX Repository Update System. WinBatchX uses wget.exe to download files from github while Windows Defender scans the files coming in.

**This repository support will end on June 1 2021. All updates will be redirected to the main "WinBatchX-Operating-System".**

**For older builds (1532-1560) will be marked with error code 0x02- unsupported release.**

**WinBatchX 15.4 (April 2021 Update) did not come with wget.exe. No user will be notified of WinBatchX 16 because it didn't come with it. (We were planing that before Build 1540)**

-Windows 10 19H1 or 19H2

-Any Windows 10 Supported Insider Builds   

-Unknown on 32-bit systems. Works on Intel 64, x64, and AMD64 Processors. ARM64 not tested.
